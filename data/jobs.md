Doesn't Matter Dinner. We serve food, not the best food, and certainly not very good food, but
atleast you won't die of food poisoning... maybe. Oh, and I completely forgot, we have job openings.
I don't know why you would want to work here, most people quit after the first week. There are no benefits
here as we simply do not have the money to pay for anything. So yeah, nice.

Active openings:

- Not a Professional Cooker.
- Floor cleaning (sorry, but we can only afford toothbrushes to clean stuff with).
- Manager, because I'm getting fired tomorrow.
- I don't know what else, just come by and stand around for awhile.

Please don't get a job here. The company might not last the month.

"Doesn't Matter Dinner, *ding dong* we simply *ding* don't care."
